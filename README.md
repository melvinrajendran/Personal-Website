<img width="1512" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-16 at 11 51 43‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33c1e4a6-cf0f-4aa8-a461-83aac714e392">

This repository houses the source code for the latest version of my personal website. The site is built using React with TypeScript, React Bootstrap components, and React Router for client-side routing. It contains information about myself, specifically my interests, work experiences, and personal projects. I've also started a small (but growing) blog about my passions aside from coding. Feel free to check it out here: https://www.melvinrajendran.com.

In many ways, this site has been my web development playground, and I've used it to apply new skills as I've learned them. I plan on adding newer details, projects, and features to it throughout my career. In the meantime, I would be more than happy to hear any feedback regarding areas of improvement.

## Notes on Prior Versions

Version 1 (v1) of my personal website was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5. Although it contained a lot of the same content as subsequent versions, it used a lot of repetitive code, had a poor project architecture, and was a little dreary with a monochrome user interface and unappealing font.

In Version 2 (v2), I implemented React functional components that, when used in conjunction with ES6 mapping, consolidated the repetitive code in Version 1.0. Furthermore, I used React hooks to animate the site's pages and custom components. As a final touch, I designed a more colorful, simplistic user interface that I'm really proud of.

The code for these previous versions is no longer (readily) available on GitHub, as I believe the current version of my website is the best reflection of my skill set. However, if you'd like to dig through the commit history and locate the older files, feel free to do so üòÅ.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
